*Arguing that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say*

## A funny story


When I was 10 years of age in morocco we used to fight with stones,
and one day I managed to hit a car so the owner was so mad he was yelling at me and he did want to punish me.

### TL;DR   
	
Stones and running.
